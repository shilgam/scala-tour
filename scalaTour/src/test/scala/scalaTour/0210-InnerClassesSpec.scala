/**
  * The implementation of a graph datatype
  * This program represents a graph as a list of nodes (List[Node]).
  *
  * The class Node is a path-dependent type because it is nested in the class Graph.
  * Therefore, all nodes in the connectedNodes must be created using the newNode from the same instance of Graph.
